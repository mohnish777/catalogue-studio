# Catalogue Studio

An Android product catalogue built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The planned product discovery, search and email-enquiry flows will use a local Node.js backend.

## Current checkpoint

The Android project setup is ready. The app launches a minimal screen displaying "Catalogue Studio". Catalogue features and the backend have not been implemented on this branch yet, and no backend is needed to run this screen.

## Run in Android Studio

1. Open the repository's `android/` directory as the project.
2. Use JDK 17 for Gradle and install Android SDK Platform 36 through SDK Manager.
3. Let Gradle sync. The wrapper selects Gradle 8.14.3 automatically.
4. Select the `app` run configuration and an emulator or device running API 26 or newer, then press Run.

Android Studio records your SDK location in `android/local.properties`, which is ignored by Git. For command-line builds, either set `ANDROID_HOME` to your SDK directory or create that file with `sdk.dir=/absolute/path/to/Android/sdk`.

## Build from the command line

From the repository root:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug --console=plain
```

The APK is written to `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`, relative to the repository root.

To install and launch on a running emulator, from `android/`:

```sh
adb devices
adb -s emulator-5554 install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s emulator-5554 shell am start -n com.cataloguestudio/.MainActivity
```

Replace `emulator-5554` with the intended device serial from `adb devices`. The CLI commands assume `adb` is on your PATH.

Run Android static checks with:

```sh
./gradlew lintDebug --console=plain
```

## Backend address for later slices

The generated `BuildConfig.BASE_URL` defaults to `http://10.0.2.2:3000`. Inside the Android Emulator, `10.0.2.2` reaches your computer's loopback interface. This address is configured now; no HTTP client or network request exists yet.

Override it at build time when needed:

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug -PapiBaseUrl=https://your-backend.example
```

For a physical device using a future local backend, use your computer's reachable LAN address instead of `10.0.2.2`. Plain HTTP is permitted only by the debug manifest. A release build needs an HTTPS backend address.
